# Digital twin project for the energy and power industry (PoC). 
<br> This serves as a PoC for a highly available, monolithic, hybrid data center.
<br>
<br>The argument is to advocate for the use of AWS services for non-core infrastructure, when permitted by 
<br>respective regulatory/compliance requirements. Whilst cloud-native network architectures are
<br>effective for certain use cases, such network architectures are not feasible for industries which
<br>require adherance to stringent workflows and documentation.
<br>
<br>Digital twins allow for predictive maintenance, provides insights into when and how assets should be
<br>upgraded or replaced, which adheres to the Cost Optimisation Pillar of the Well-Architected Framework.
